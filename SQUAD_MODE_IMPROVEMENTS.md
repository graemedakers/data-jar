# Squad Mode: Feature Improvement Options

A curated list of features to enhance the "Group Jar" experience for friends, families, and double dates.

## 1. Decision Making & Democracy
For groups, "Random Spin" can be risky. Adding democratic layers helps consensus.

*   **Voting Mode (The "Runoff"):** Instead of 1 result, the Jar spins 3 options. Members vote (ranked choice or simple majority). The winner is the final plan.
*   **Veto Power:** Each member gets 1 "Veto" card per month. If the Jar picks something they hate, they can burn their Veto to force a re-spin.
*   **"Host's Choice":** The Admin (Host) spins 3 options, but *they* pick the final one. Good for decisiveness.

## 2. Logistics & Planning
Handling the "boring stuff" for the group.

*   **Availability Heatmap:** Users input their free days/evenings. The Jar only highlights days where >80% of the group is free.
*   **Calendar Overlay:** Integrate with Google/Apple Calendar to show conflict warnings when a date is picked.
*   **Ride-Share Deep Links:** When a location is revealed, a button "Get Uber/Lyft" pre-fills the destination for all members.
*   **Bill Splitter:** Simple tracker attached to the "Memory" of the event. "Who paid?" and "Split evenly?". (Integration with Splitwise possible).

## 3. Social & Engagement
Making the app stickier between dates.

*   **"The Hype Train" (Chat):** A dedicated comment thread for each active Plan. "What time we meeting?", "I'm running late".
*   **Shared Photo Album:** All members can upload photos to the "Memory" of that event. (Using the existing Google Photos integration, adapted for shared folders).
*   **Leaderboards:** "Most Active Planner", "The Flaker" (careful with this one), "Vibe Curator".
*   **"Vibe" Filters:** Tag ideas with vibes (e.g. "Ratchet", "Wholesome", "Chill", "Active"). Spin based on the group's current mood.

## 4. Content & Discovery
*   **Themed Packs:** "Bachelor Party Pack", "Brunch Spots", "Hiking Trails". Users can import these packs into their group jar.
*   **Collaborative Playlists:** Link a Spotify playlist to the Jar. "The Roadtrip Playlist".

## 5. Roles & Administration
*   **Guest Mode:** Allow a user to join via a temporary link for *one events* (without creating a full account/downloading app). Good for "The +1".
*   **Co-Hosts:** Allow multiple admins to manage the jar settings.
